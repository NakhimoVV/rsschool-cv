I love design & programming and create user-friendly interfaces, and the frontend is exactly what I need!
Therefore, my goal is to be a mega professional at this. And then we'll see.

I am responsible, quick to learn, purposeful, stress-resistant, have an analytical mindset.

Today I have independently learned what I display in the links to my portfolio. And I really want to do better and better! And for this I need to study a lot and practice.
